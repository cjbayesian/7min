7-Minute Workout from the Command Line
======================================

Ever since [this article in the New York Times](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_r=0) about a scientific 7-minute workout, hackers have found a new motivation for getting up from there deskchairs to move a little. I mean, it only takes 7 minutes, after all.

I have found it to be a great way to get the heart pumping in between coding sessions. I've used [7-min.com](http://www.7-min.com/) to guide me through it. Recently, however, I was on vacation and did not have internet access. Asside from all of the other symptoms of withdrawl I was experiencing, I wasn't able to access the workout app. Instead of taking the obvious route of using it as an excuse to slack off \(I was on vacation, after all\), I thought I'd whip up an offline version, and `7min.py` was born!

Requirements
-------------

You need python, of course, but also `aplay` which you can get using `apt-get install aplay` on debian like systems. If you're using OSX, you may need to modify the script to use the sox utility `play` command.

Usage
-----

    1. Stretch liberally.
    2. Make sure no one is looking
    3. Run w7min
